## Future Improvements
There are a bunch of improvements we'd love to make to the app in the future. Here are some examples:

<ul>
  <li>Allow users to update info about subs they create, as well as update posts and comments they make</li>
  <li>Add more user functionality such as a "user page" where they can view and update their information as well as see communities they follow, posts/comments they've made, etc.</li>
  <li>Make it so a user can only upvote or downvote once</li>
  <li>Extend upvote functionality to comments</li>
  <li>Add more functionality to subs like tracking number of members</li>
  
</ul>
